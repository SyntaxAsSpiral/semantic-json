# Semantic JSON

**Obsidian plugin that compiles Canvas files to semantic JSON through visuospatial encoding—reading visual field semantics (position, containment, color, directionality) into stable, readable linear order for humans and AI.**

## What is JSON Canvas?

[JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org/) is an open file format for infinite canvas data, originally developed for Obsidian Canvas. It promotes longevity, readability, interoperability, and extensibility using the `.canvas` extension and a simple JSON structure with nodes and edges. Infinite canvas tools organize information **spatially** like a digital whiteboard.

## Why This Plugin?

By default, Obsidian "scrambles" the z-index array on every save, losing the spatial and structural meaning that Canvas format is designed to capture. This plugin recompiles the canvas, reencoding visual intent into stable, deterministic JSON:

- **Position** (x, y) → Linear reading sequence (top-left to bottom-right)
- **Containment** (bounding boxes) → Hierarchical structure (groups + children)
- **Color** (node/edge colors) → Semantic taxonomy (red=urgent, blue=reference, etc.)
- **Directionality** (arrow endpoints) → Information flow topology (source → sink)

**Benefits:**
- **Git diffs**: Clean, predictable diffs—only meaningful changes show up
- **LLM ingestion**: Semantically ordered for AI comprehension without spatial reconstruction
- **Human readability**: Logical flow instead of random noise
- **Canvas rendering**: Displays identically—only the underlying JSON order changes

## Features

- **Auto-compile on save**: Seamless workflow—canvas files automatically reorder when saved
- **Hierarchical ordering**: Groups followed immediately by their contents, depth-first traversal
- **Content-based sorting**: Nodes sort by semantic content (text/file path/URL/label) instead of random IDs
- **Color taxonomy**: Optional color grouping preserves visual categories (enabled by default)
- **Flow topology sorting**: Optional directional flow analysis—arrows define execution order, transforming spatial diagrams into sequential narratives (disabled by default)
- **Topology-based edge sorting**: Edges ordered by connected node positions (or flow depth when flow sorting enabled)
- **CLI tool**: Included for batch processing or CI pipelines
- **Spec-compliant**: Pure JSON Canvas extension—no custom properties, works with all Canvas tools

## Installation

### From Obsidian Community Plugins

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Navigate to Community Plugins
3. Search for "Semantic JSON"
4. Click Install, then Enable

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SyntaxAsSpiral/semantic-json/releases)
2. Extract to `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/semantic-json/`
3. Reload Obsidian
4. Enable "Semantic JSON" in Community Plugins settings

## Usage

### Commands (via Command Palette)

- **"Compile active canvas"**: Reorders the `.canvas` file in-place (no visual changes in UI, no extra files)
- **"Export canvas to JSON"**: Creates a separate `.json` file alongside the `.canvas`

### Settings

- **Auto-compile on save** (default: enabled): Automatically reorder canvas files when saved
- **Color sort nodes** (default: enabled): Group nodes by color within same spatial position
- **Color sort edges** (default: enabled): Group edges by color within same topology
- **Flow sort nodes** (default: disabled): Sort by directional flow topology instead of spatial position

## Standalone CLI Tool
See [`cli/canvas-compile.mjs`](./cli/canvas-compile.mjs) for usage details.

```bash
node cli/canvas-compile.mjs --in <path-to-.canvas> [--out <path-to-.json>]
```

## Specification

Full technical specification available in [`semantic-json-spec.md`](./semantic-json-spec.md).

### Compilation Ordering

**Nodes** are reordered hierarchically based on spatial containment:
1. Root orphan nodes (not contained by groups)
2. Root groups, immediately followed by their contents (depth-first)
3. Nested groups follow the same pattern recursively

**Within each scope**, nodes are sorted by (when flow sorting disabled):
- Spatial position (y, x)
- Node type priority (link nodes to bottom like footnotes)
- Color (optional, groups same-colored nodes)
- Content (text/file path/URL/label instead of random IDs)

**When flow sorting enabled:**
- Directional edges create conceptual flow groups
- Nodes sort by topological order (source → intermediate → sink)
- Flow depth overrides type priority—link nodes stay in flow order
- Isolated nodes use standard spatial sorting

**Edges** are sorted by:
- `fromNode` position (y, x) or flow depth
- `toNode` position (y, x) or flow depth
- Color (optional, groups same-colored edges)
- Edge ID (fallback for determinism)

This transforms spatial diagrams into linear narratives that preserve visual semantics, making flow diagrams, system architectures, and knowledge graphs immediately legible to LLMs without spatial reconstruction.

## Examples

See [`examples/conformance-test-card.canvas`](./examples/conformance-test-card.canvas) for a self-documenting test demonstrating:
- Hierarchical group containment
- Spatial grid ordering (3×3 table)
- Nested parent-child groups
- Color-coded nodes and edges
- Directional flow patterns (horizontal green edges, vertical cyan edges)

The test card is pre-sorted in the repo, so opening it in Obsidian and saving will scramble it—demonstrating exactly what this plugin fixes.

## Development

```bash
npm install
