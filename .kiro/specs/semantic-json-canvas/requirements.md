# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Semantic JSON Canvas plugin transforms Obsidian Canvas files from scrambled, position-randomized JSON into semantically ordered, human and LLM-readable documents. This system acts as an "anticompiler" that surfaces spatial meaning explicitly encoded in Canvas visual syntax, creating stable Git diffs and coherent document structure while maintaining full JSON Canvas spec compliance. 

The system now includes advanced content intelligence through smart content-aware sorting that recognizes YAML, Markdown, JSON, and code structures, plus emergent type systems that infer locally-appropriate taxonomies and assign semantic node IDs. This positions semantic-json as a true "lingua franca" for structured data across formats, making each canvas self-describing with coherent type systems.

The plugin includes both Obsidian integration and standalone CLI tools for batch processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Spatial Semantic Compilation

**User Story:** As a Canvas user, I want my Canvas files to maintain semantic order based on visual layout, so that the JSON structure reflects the intended reading flow and remains stable across saves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Canvas file is compiled, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL order nodes by spatial position (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
2. WHEN nodes are contained within groups, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL create hierarchical nesting with depth-first traversal
3. WHEN nodes have the same spatial position, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL sort by type priority (content nodes before links)
4. WHEN nodes have identical position and type, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL sort alphabetically by content key
5. THE Semantic_JSON SHALL preserve all original Canvas data without adding or removing fields

### Requirement 2: Flow Topology Processing

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want directional arrows to define information flow order, so that my process diagrams become sequential narratives in the compiled JSON.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN flow sorting is enabled, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL analyze edge directionality to determine topological order
2. WHEN nodes are connected by directional edges, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL sort by flow depth using BFS-based topological sorting
3. WHEN edges have bidirectional arrows, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL resolve direction based on neighboring edge patterns
4. WHEN nodes are isolated from flow groups, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL fall back to spatial sorting
5. THE Semantic_JSON SHALL support forward arrows (default), reverse arrows, and bidirectional edges

### Requirement 3: Hierarchical Containment

**User Story:** As a knowledge organizer, I want spatial containment to create explicit nesting, so that group structures are preserved in linear reading order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node's bounding box falls entirely within a group's bounding box, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL treat it as contained
2. WHEN nodes overlap multiple groups, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL assign to the smallest containing group by area

4. WHEN processing group contents, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL sort children semantically before moving to next sibling group
5. THE Semantic_JSON SHALL handle orphan nodes according to the semanticSortOrphans configuration setting

### Requirement 4: Color Taxonomy Preservation

**User Story:** As a visual thinker, I want color coding to be preserved in the compiled order, so that semantic categories remain grouped together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN color sorting is enabled, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL group nodes by color within same spatial position
2. WHEN nodes have preset colors (1-6) or hex colors, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL sort by color value
3. WHEN nodes are uncolored, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL place them before colored nodes
4. WHEN color sorting is disabled, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL ignore color in sorting decisions
5. THE Semantic_JSON SHALL apply color sorting to both nodes and edges independently based on settings

### Requirement 5: Edge Compilation and Topology

**User Story:** As a systems architect, I want edge relationships to follow logical flow order, so that connection diagrams read as coherent sequences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling edges in spatial mode, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL sort by fromNode position then toNode position
2. WHEN compiling edges in flow mode, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL sort by topological depth of connected nodes
3. WHEN edges have labels, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL preserve label information in compiled order
4. WHEN edges have colors and color sorting is enabled, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL group by color within same topology
5. THE Semantic_JSON SHALL maintain edge directionality metadata (fromEnd, toEnd, fromSide, toSide)

### Requirement 6: Pure JSON Export with Labeled Edge Embedding

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to export clean JSON without Canvas metadata, so that I can use the structured data in other systems while preserving semantic order and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting pure JSON, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL strip spatial metadata (x, y, width, height)
2. WHEN exporting pure JSON, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL strip visual metadata (color, background, backgroundStyle)
3. WHEN exporting pure JSON, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL preserve node structure (id, type, text, file, url, label)
4. WHEN labeled edges exist, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL embed them as directional arrays (from/to) in connected nodes
5. WHEN flow sorting is enabled or stripEdgesWhenFlowSorted is true, THE Semantic_JSON SHALL remove unlabeled edges from export

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Import System with Visual Features

**User Story:** As a data visualizer, I want to import JSON and JSONL files as Canvas structures with enhanced visual features, so that I can visually edit structured data and export it back to clean JSON.
